Description:
For this assignment, I added a timeIntervel to mark the time that draw the letter and the time of next letter was draw so I can control the velocity in real pixels per second.
Also I make the words into a char array, and randomly access the index of the array to output a chinese poem which is “Blue mountains lie across the northern outskirts; white water circles around the eastern town. Once we part from this place, a lone thistledown will be on a thousand-mile journey.A floating cloud is what you want to be like; the setting sun is how your old friend feels.A wave of the hand, and we go our own way.Whinny, whinny, the horses neigh.”, in this way, I think the user will catch a set of raindrops that spell out a whole word.
For the extra work I did for this assignment, I not only added a velocity to the vertical direction, but also the horizontal direction. It makes the rain drop more reasonably and easy for user to catch a whole word. And when letters hit a back pixels the letters will turn to red which means ‘hit’ on a black pixel.
